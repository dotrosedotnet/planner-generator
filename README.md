# Planner Maker

A tool for generating custom Hobonichi-style planners

## Description

This project hopes to be a generator for custom planners. The dream is generation of a full year planner pdf which can then be sent to a printer. The pdf will include whatever sections the user wants, in whatever order they want, laid out how they want. There will be a web interface for the planner generator.

I'm starting with hand-coded postscript of a daily timeline. I suspect that I'll want to generate the postscript with python eventually. I look forward to exploring options for the web interface. Recommendations welcome.
